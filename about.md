Hi folks!

Iâ€™m glad to meet you! Welcome to the pages of our blog.
It's a place where a group of enthusiasts comes together to share knowledge and ideas.
Programming is a magnificent tool where we use engineering and maths to create art.

Math provide an opportunity to create your ideas in an inexpensive way, without the use of expensive construction.
Programming is the same.
You can create a prototype of your projects to check your ideas.
In our blog, we prepare practical [code katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) for self-improvement.
We are pleased to offer them to you.

We would be so happy if you would take a part in our network as a writer, reviewer, implementor or somebody else.

Heads Up! English isn't native to us and it's a challenge.
We have a different level of it. Please excuse us:) If you found a mistake or want to help us, send a fix to Github or Email.
